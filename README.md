# DicomToNumpyArray

This is a simple python script which will convert .dcm files to .npy files which can be then read for most machine learning purposes. 

How to use:

1) Download/Clone the repo
2) Change the PathDicom variable to the location of all of your .dcm files
3) Hit run!

If the script was successful, then you should see .npy files along with your .npy

You can modify the script to have python save the .npy files in a seperate directory!

Cheers!
